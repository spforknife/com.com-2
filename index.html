            New to HTML ? So am i (allegedly) <br>
            This website was birthed from the spite that came from the fact that pycharm doesn't have Javascript or CSS when it's free. That's why although this website has necessary CSS, it'll also add any possible purely HTML workarounds. Also, it'll be Javascript free, just to show the capabbilities of HTML and CSS alone.
            <br> That being said, I'll be posting my progress here too !
